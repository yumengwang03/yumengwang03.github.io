Suppose we want to know a person's probability of having cancer, but we know nothing about him or her. Despite not knowing anything about that person, a probability can be assigned based on the general prevalence of cancer. For the sake of this example, suppose it is 1%. This is known as the base rate or prior probability of having cancer. "Prior" refers to the time before being informed about the particular case at hand.Next, suppose we find out that person is 65 years old. If we assume that cancer and age are related, this new piece of information can be used to better assess that person's risk of having cancer. More precisely, we'd like to know the probability that a person has cancer when it is known that he or she is 65 years old. This quantity is known as the current probability, where "current" refers to the theorised situation upon finding out information about the particular case at hand.In order to apply knowledge of that person's age in conjunction with Bayes' Theorem, two additional pieces of information are needed. Note, however, that the additional information is not specific to that person. The needed information is as follows:
